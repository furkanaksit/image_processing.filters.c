# image_processing.filters.c
Applying gauss, sobel and laplacian filters using convolution matrix

It is early stage of the project.

Things to be done:
  *optimize reading .pgm files
  *calculate the gaussian filter yourself
  *general optimization
  *there is problem with naming the file - sort it out

"Written for Image Processing course."


Read .PGM files.

Apply Gaussian Filter for Noise Reduction                 -
Apply Sobel Filter for Edge Detection                     -   Use Convolution Matrix Method to apply filters

Apply Laplacian to the original image for Edge Detection  -

Write processed image to new .PGM file

Calculate the success of the filters in Edge Detection
