# image_processing.filters.c
Applying gauss, sobel and laplacian filters using convolution matrix

It is early stage of the project.

Things to be done:
  *optimize reading .pgm files
  *calculate the gaussian filter yourself
  *general optimization
  *there is problem with naming the file - sort it out
  
"Written for Image Processing Course."


Read .PGM files.

Apply Gaussian Filter for Noise Reduction                 -
Apply Sobel Filter for Edge Detection                     -   Use Convolution Matrix Method to apply filters

Apply Laplacian to the original image for Edge Detection  -

Write processed image to new .PGM file

Calculate the success of the filters in Edge Detection


** You need to use command line to run the program as photo_reader_V1.exe name_of_the_image

This program has developed in the beginning of third grade of Computer Engineering Bachelor Degree.
As it can be seen it is fairly basic program and it has too many mistakes. It will stay in my repository to allow people to see my progress.
New program is a 2 hour challenge for myself after 14 months.
